`lsanomaly` is a flexible, fast, probabilistic method for calculating outlier scores on test data, given
training examples of inliers. Out of the box it works well with `scikit-learn` packages. See the features section
for why you might chose this model over other options.

Features
--------

-  Compatible with scikit-learn package modules
-  Probabilistic outlier detection model
-  Robust classifier when given multiple inlier classes
-  Easy to install and get started

Installation
------------

The best way to install lsanomaly is to:

::

    pip install lsanomaly

An alternative is to download the source code and

::

   python setup.py install

Tests can be run from `setup` if `pytest` is installed:

::

   python setup.py test

Usage
-----

For those familiar with scikit-learn the interface will be familiar, in fact `lsanomaly` was built to be compatible
with `sklearn` modules where applicable. Here is basic usage of `lsanomaly` to get started quick as possible.

**Configuring the Model**

LSAD provides reasonable default parameters when given an empty init or it can be passed values for `rho` and `sigma`. The value rho controls sensitivity to outliers and sigma determines the ‘smoothness’ of the
boundary. These values can be tuned to improve your results using lsanomaly.

.. code:: python

    from lsanomaly import LSAnomaly

    # At train time lsanomaly calculates parameters rho and sigma
    lsanomaly = LSAnomaly()
    # or
    lsanomaly = LSAnomaly(sigma=3, rho=0.1, seed=42)

**Training the Model**

After the model is configured the training data can be fit.

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np
   lsanomaly = LSAnomaly(sigma=3, rho=0.1, seed=42)
   lsanomaly.fit(np.array([[1],[2],[3],[1],[2],[3]]))

**Making Predictions**

Now that the data is fit, we will probably want to try and predict on some data not in the training set.

.. code:: python

    >>> lsanomaly.predict(np.array([[0]]))
    [0.0]
    >>> lsanomaly.predict_proba(np.array([[0]]))
    array([[ 0.7231233,  0.2768767]])

Evaluating LSAnomaly
--------------------
Scripts for evaluating `lsanomaly` against other methods is provided in J Quinn's software
https://cit.mak.ac.ug/staff/jquinn/software/lsanomaly.html.
Owing to changes in APIs and availability of some test data, that code has been refactored and expanded.

There are three commandline applications that will be download the test data, perform a 5-fold
cross-validation and, produce a LaTeX document summarizing the results. Each of the three applications has
a `main` method that can be used for further automation.

The following datasets are configured for download (see `evaluate/eval_params.yml`) from
https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/.

- australian
- breast-cancer
- cod-rna
- colon-cancer.bz2
- diabetes
- dna.scale
- glass.scale
- heart
- ionosphere_scale
- letter.scale
- leu.bz2
- mnist.bz2
- mushrooms
- pendigits
- satimage.scale
- sonar_scale

Those with an extension of `.bz2` will be inflated. The compressed
version is retained.
