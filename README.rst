`lsanomaly` is a flexible, fast, probabilistic method for calculating outlier scores on test data, given
training examples of inliers. Out of the box it works well with `scikit-learn` packages. See the features section
for why you might chose this model over other options.

Features
--------

-  Compatible with scikit-learn package modules
-  Probabilistic outlier detection model
-  Robust classifier when given multiple inlier classes
-  Easy to install and get started

Installation
------------

The best way to install lsanomaly is to:

::

    pip install lsanomaly

An alternative is to download the source code and

::

   python setup.py install

Tests can be run from `setup` if `pytest` is installed:

::

   python setup.py test

or the usual

::

   py.test -v

Usage
-----

For those familiar with scikit-learn the interface will be familiar, in fact `lsanomaly` was built to be compatible
with `sklearn` modules where applicable. Here is basic usage of `lsanomaly` to get started quick as possible.

**Configuring the Model**

LSAD provides reasonable default parameters when given an empty init or it can be passed values for `rho` and `sigma`. The value rho controls sensitivity to outliers and sigma determines the ‘smoothness’ of the
boundary. These values can be tuned to improve your results using `lsanomaly`.

.. code:: python

    from lsanomaly import LSAnomaly

    # At train time lsanomaly calculates parameters rho and sigma
    lsanomaly = LSAnomaly()
    # or
    lsanomaly = LSAnomaly(sigma=3, rho=0.1, seed=42)

**Training the Model**

After the model is configured the training data can be fit.

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np
   lsanomaly = LSAnomaly(sigma=3, rho=0.1, seed=42)
   lsanomaly.fit(np.array([[1],[2],[3],[1],[2],[3]]))

**Making Predictions**

Now that the data is fit, we will probably want to try and predict on some data not in the training set.

.. code:: python

    >>> lsanomaly.predict(np.array([[0]]))
    [0.0]
    >>> lsanomaly.predict_proba(np.array([[0]]))
    array([[ 0.7231233,  0.2768767]])
